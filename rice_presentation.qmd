## The Urgency of Climate Action

- UNEP 2024: Projected warming of **2.6–3.1°C** by 2100 even with full NDC compliance.
- 42% emissions cut by 2030, 57% by 2035 needed for 1.5°C goal.
- Classic **collective action problem**: Everyone benefits, but no one wants to pay.

::: notes
Use this to establish urgency. Mention how even ambitious pledges fall short. Introduce the problem of free-riding clearly.

## Research Objective

> **What are the economic and environmental outcomes of cooperative vs non-cooperative climate action among major emitters?**

- The United States, European Union, China, and India

::: notes
Clarify the basic question and simulation setup. Mention that Nash equilibrium means strategic independence.

## From DICE to RICE

| DICE (Global)           | RICE (Regional)          |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Single global region   | Multiple heterogeneous regions |
| Aggregate emissions    | Regional emissions       |
| Global damage function | Regional damage profiles |


- Developed by **William Nordhaus**.
- RICE better reflects real-world policy complexity.

::: notes
Use this to bridge to model selection. Show why RICE is more realistic and policy-relevant.
:::

## Model Structure

1. **Economic Module**: GDP via Cobb-Douglas
2. **Emissions Module**: GDP × carbon intensity
3. **Climate Module**: Radiative forcing → warming
4. **Damage Function**: Temp-driven output loss
5. **Abatement Cost Function**: Convex mitigation cost
6. **Welfare Function**: Discounted per capita utility

::: notes
Walk through each module briefly. Emphasize how the structure enables equity-aware comparisons.
:::

---

## Implementation Tools

- Simulations run using [white-heomoi/RICE13_pyomo](https://github.com/white-heomoi/RICE13_pyomo), a Python-based adaptation of Nordhaus’ RICE model.
- Simulated Time Horizon: 2005–2125 (in 10-year steps)
- All runs used the model’s default configuration without modification.

::: notes
Mention credibility and reproducibility from using open-source code.

## Scenario Design

Two scenarios:

- **Non-Cooperative (Nash Equilibrium)** — regions act independently.
- **Cooperative (Global Optimum)** — regions coordinate for shared welfare.

> **Focus**: Comparing *carbon pricing*, *emissions*, and *temperature* across both scenarios.

::: notes
Explain that these are stylized scenarios—good for comparative insights.

## Results: Carbon Pricing

:::

::: {.column width="35%"}


| Region | 2005 | 2070 |
|--------|------|------|
| US     | 0.084% | 0.378% |
| EU     | 0.015% | 0.094% |
| CHI    | 0.003% | 0.042% |
| IND    | 0.00008% | 0.0044%  |

::: notes
Highlight the pricing divergence. Emphasize how cooperation drives meaningful carbon pricing while non-cooperation stagnates.

## Results: Emissions Trajectories

### Global Emissions

::: notes
Use this to show the difference in emissions behavior. Regional strategies align more under cooperation.

## Results: Temperature Projections

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
<img src="assets/temperature_projection.png" style="max-height:65vh; object-fit:contain;">
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

- Cooperative: ~3.78°C by 2125
- Non-cooperative: ~4.18°C by 2125
:::
:::

::: notes
Explain why even small temperature shifts are significant: melting ice, sea levels, biodiversity, etc.

## Policy Implications

- Cooperation raises global welfare but benefits are unevenly shared
- High-cost or vulnerable regions may need support to join and stay in agreements
- Fairness is essential for stable long-term cooperation
- Policy tools to support equity; *Financial transfers*, *Technology sharing*, and *Capacity-building for adaptation*


::: notes
Policy connection slide—tie your findings to active climate frameworks.

## Limitations & Extensions

- Simplified climate damages
- Exogenous tech change
- No behavioral/political feedbacks

**Future work:**

- Endogenous innovation
- Tipping points, uncertainty
- Multi-actor strategic modeling

::: notes
Good slide to show humility and realism about modeling boundaries.
:::

---

## Final Thoughts

**Thesis:** Cooperation improves outcomes.

- Emissions ↓, Temperatures ↓, Welfare ↑
- Requires fairness, flexibility, trust
- Cooperation must become the **default**

> "Climate change is a shared crisis. Solutions must be shared too."

::: notes
Reiterate your core takeaway with confidence and clarity.
